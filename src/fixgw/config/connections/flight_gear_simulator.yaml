# FlightGear Flight Simulator Module
# To start FlightGear with these paramaters, use the following command...
#   >fgfs --generic=socket,out,10,localhost,5500,udp,fix_fgfs --generic=socket,in,1,,5501,udp,fix_fgfs
# The config file connection/fix_fgfs.xml file should be in the FG_ROOT/Protocols directory which should be
# in one of the following locations...
# LINUX: /usr/share/games/flightgear/
# OSX: /Applications/FlightGear.app/Contents/Resources/data/
# WINDOWS: c:\Program Files\FlightGear\data\
# When running as a snap we do not have access to the flight gear root directory.
# In this case we refer to the file in the fixgw config folder.
# The default configuration here will work under snap or not.
# What is important, if you edit the fix_fgfs.xml file, ENSURE you updated it in the flightgear folder too
fgfs:
  load: FLIGHT_GEAR
  module: fixgw.plugins.fgfs
  # This should be the same as $FG_ROOT on your system.  It is used to help
  # fixgw find the xml configuration files
  # When running under snap we do not have access to the flightgear folder
  # So we refer to a copy of the file in the fixgw config folder
  fg_root: ~/makerplane/fixgw/config/connections/fgfs
  # fg_root: /Applications/FlightGear.app/Contents/Resources/data/
  # fg_root: c:\Program Files\FlightGear\data\
  # This is the name of the protocol config file that fixgw and fgfs will use to
  # define the protocol. It is very important that both programs are looking at
  # the same file.
