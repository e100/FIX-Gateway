# In an effort to have some redundancy I wanted a way to control some things,
# such as the auto pilot, from only one gateway at a time. But should one gateway fail
# the other can takover sending commands to the auto pilot. 
# Some keys were created in the database:
# QVOTEn, n is the node id and each node will set its own value.
# LEADER, leader is true if this gateway has the highest vote.
# 
# The module fixgw.quorum contains the bool variable quorum.leader that can be used
# to determine if you are the leader.
#
# NOTE: LEADER could have just been a global variable, making it a fixid allows us to also check the status from 
# other applications. For example we could display a message in pyEFIS if the local canfix is the LEADER or not.
#
# Each node should be configured to send their QVOTEn key to all other nodes in the cluster
# Using the netfix unless you are using canfix. It is not necessary to send the other QVOTEs just the local one.
#
# canfix will automatically send the local QVOTE, no configuration other than enabeling canfix is needed.
# canfix will also import the QVOTE from the other nodes
#
# LEADER is set to true by default, so if this plugin is not used, LEADER will always be true, unless you change it.
# So LEADER can be used in plugins for making decision on actions to ensure only the leader is performing those actions.
# The mavlink plugin is the first one I updated to support this, it will only send commands to the auto pilot
# from the LEADER node. Sinec the auto pilot has multiple serial ports it can be connected to multiple nodes
# at the same time but only receive commands from one node.
