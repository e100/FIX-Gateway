# This plugin should be considered experimental
# Use at your own risk
# At this time it has seen no real-world use and testing
#
#
# This plugin listens for NMEA data sent to port 2000 from the iFly EFB app.
# When configuring ifly, the only NMEA data we need is RMB and APB
# At this time it does not seem possible to capture altitude data for waypoints
# This plugin only captures the next destination not the entire flight plan
# It is possible to get the data about the entire plan so this could be
# a future enhancement.
#
# The data is stored into three FIX database keys:
# WPNAME = the name of the waypoint
# WPLON = longitude of the waypoint
# WPLAT = latitude of the waypoint


# Potential issues:
#  Getting iFly to send to the FIX gateway might be a problem, it only seems to send to
#  the address 192.168.1.1
#  If you run iFly on waydroid and have waydroid running on the same computer
#  as the Fix gateway you can add that IP address to the waydroid0 interface
#  and this plugin will pickup the data from iFly
#
#  sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.1/24 dev waydroid0
#
#  Once when I inserted a new stop into the flight plan I observed the destination programmed into
#  the flight controller flipping back and forth between the old and new destination
#  I have since been unable to reproduce this error
